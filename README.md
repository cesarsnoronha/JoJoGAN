>**Abstract:**<br>
While there have been recent advances in few-shot image stylization, these methods fail to capture stylistic details
that are obvious to humans. Details such as the shape of the eyes, the boldness of the lines, are especially difficult
for a model to learn, especially so under a limited data setting. In this work, we aim to perform one-shot image stylization that gets the details right. Given
a reference style image, we approximate paired real data using GAN inversion and finetune a pretrained StyleGAN using
that approximate paired data. We then encourage the StyleGAN to generalize so that the learned style can be applied
to all other images.

## Updates
* `2021-12-25` Added arcane_multi model which is trained on 4 arcane faces instead of 1 (if anyone has more clean data, let me know!). Better preserves features.

* `2021-12-23` Paper is uploaded to [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11641).
* `2021-12-22` Integrated into [Huggingface Spaces ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). Try it out [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/JoJoGAN)
* `2021-12-22` Added pydrive authentication to avoid download limits from gdrive! Fixed running on cpu on colab.



## How to use
Everything to get started is in the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mchong6/JoJoGAN/blob/main/stylize.ipynb).

You need to clone the github repository,
them only download the stylize.ipynb file.
upload it to your google drive.
On the beggining of the stylize.ipynb file change the github path to yours
On your github upload the images you want to process to the folder "test_inputs"
